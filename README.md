### Mascot Generator

---

This project is a text-to-image pipeline that creates a consistent, high-quality 3D animated character. Using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to fine-tune Stable Diffusion v1.5, this project generates the mascot in various poses and scenarios. Built entirely on Google Colab, it offers an efficient and straightforward workflow for character-specific art—just run the notebook and start generating!

### 🚀 Features

* **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create a consistent character from simple text prompts.
* **Character Consistency:** Ensures the mascot's appearance remains consistent across different poses and scenarios.
* **Efficient Workflow:** LoRA enables effective training on a single GPU.
* **No Setup Required:** Just upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab and run the cells.
* **Local Session:** All generation happens within your local Colab environment—no data stored or shared.
